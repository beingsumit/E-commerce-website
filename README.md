# E-commerce-website
We have created a E-commerce website using HTML, CSS, ReactJS, JavaScript, MongoDB, NodeJS, where both admin as well as users can login using the credentials provided by
them. We have stored the data in MongoDB atlas cloud database.


- Admin can change the contains on the website like add product, delete any product, update the details of the product etc.
- For new users, we created a registration form. For users, their e-mail is kept as their username to login. There is also facility
for users to add any item which they want to cart.

To run this programme you have to install ReactJS, JavaScript, MongoDB, NodeJS. Then open the project with vscode or any other application. Then open the terminal there and run command npm i. Then the project will be hosted on your browser locally.


Following are some of the glimpses of our project
